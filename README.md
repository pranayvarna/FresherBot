# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline 🚀
This repository showcases two implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer user queries by combining document retrieval with natural language generation.

# Key Features
# Task 1 🔍

🌐 Website Crawling: Scrapes text data from specified websites.

📊 FAISS Indexing: Embeds and indexes content for efficient similarity search.

🧠 BLOOM: Generates precise and context-aware responses to user queries.
# Task 2 📚

⚡ Enhanced pipeline for faster indexing and improved scalability.

🎯 Optimized embeddings and retrieval processes for advanced use cases.

# Requirements 
Install the required Python libraries to use the pipeline:

🤗 transformers

🔎 sentence-transformers

🧠 faiss-cpu (or faiss-gpu for better performance)

🥣 beautifulsoup4

🌐 requests

# Acknowledgments 

FAISS: For efficient similarity search.

SentenceTransformer: For high-quality text embeddings.

BLOOM: For open-source natural language generation.
